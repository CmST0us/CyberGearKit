/* Public: Reads a subset of bits into a uint64_t, right aligned so they may be
 * interpreted as a number.
 *
 * source - the bytes in question.
 * source_size - the number of bytes in the source.
 * offset - the starting index of the bit field (beginning from 0).
 * bit_count - the width of the bit field to extract. This must be less than or
 *      equal to 64.
 *
 * Bit fields are positioned according to big-endian bit layout and the data is
 * swapped automatically as necessary depending on the compiled architecture.
 *
 * For example, the bit layout of the value "42" (i.e. 00101010 set at position
 * 14 with length 6 is:
 *
 *     000000000000001010100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
 *
 * and the same value and position but with length 8 is:
 *
 *     000000000000000010101000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
 *
 * Examples
 *
 *  uint64_t value = get_bitfield(data, data_size, 2, 4);
 *
 * Returns the value of the requested bit field, right aligned in a uint64_t.

 * 0, i.e. bit index is the leftmost bit of byte 0. Endianness does not matter.
